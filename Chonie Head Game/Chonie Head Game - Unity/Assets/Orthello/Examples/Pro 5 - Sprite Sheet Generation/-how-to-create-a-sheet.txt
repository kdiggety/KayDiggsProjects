  To use the create a spritesheet functionality,

  1. Create an empty scene and add the OT main object
     or open the CProExample5 unity scene.

  2. Select the folder that contains all images you want to
     put on the spritesheet.

     IMPORTANT! in Unity4 the folder is only selected when you
     select a file in that particular folder. So select one 
     of the images when in Unity4

  3. Accept this image path by clicking the 'Use Import Path' button

  4. No configure the settings and click the 'Create Sprite Sheet' Button
